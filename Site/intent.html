    <p style="text-align: center;">
        From the Latin prefix "in," meaning into/on/upon, and the root "tendere," meaning to stretch, strain, or strive (in quest of something).  
        In other words, to direct one's attention. We are here to discover (literally dis-cover, remove the veil from) the mysteries of our world.  
        "Who, What, When, and Where" will explain our present condition.  "Why" will give us the philosophy 
        (from the Greek philo- "loving" and sophia- "knowledge, wisdom").  These are prerequisite.  "How" will give us the tools to achieve what we desire.
