    <h2>You are here for a reason. You are here to discover.</h2>
    <h3>Discover (v.) - to reveal. From the Latin - dis, "opposite of" + cooperire, "to cover up, bury"</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        In order to see ahead, it is necessary to first remove the veil from what is in front of us presently.

    <h3>Intent</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        From the Latin prefix "in," meaning into/on/upon, and the root "tendere," meaning to stretch, strain, or strive (in quest of something).
        In other words, to direct one's attention. We are here to discover (literally dis-cover, remove the veil from) the mysteries of our world.
        "Who, What, When, and Where" will explain our present condition.  "Why" will give us the philosophy
        (from the Greek philo- "loving" and sophia- "knowledge, wisdom").  These are prerequisite.  "How" will give us the tools to achieve what we desire.
